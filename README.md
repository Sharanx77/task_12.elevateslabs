## 🚀 About The Project

**"Horizon Gallery"** was developed for the **Elevate Labs Web Development Internship (Task 12)**. This project moves beyond static layouts to implement dynamic **State Management** using JavaScript. It demonstrates how to handle user interactions—such as clicking, keyboard navigation, and scroll-locking—to create a seamless viewing experience.



### 🎯 Key Features
* **Custom Modal Engine:** A handcrafted JavaScript system that dynamically updates content based on the user's selection without page reloads.
* **Smart Interaction:** Includes background overlay focusing, auto-scroll prevention when viewing images, and a "Click-to-Exit" backdrop.
* **Keyboard Accessibility:** Full support for the "ESC" key to close the modal, making it user-friendly for all navigation styles.
* **Glassmorphic UI:** A modern design aesthetic using CSS backdrop-filters and smooth scale-up transitions on hover.
* **Responsive Grid:** Utilizes CSS Grid with auto-fit logic to ensure the gallery looks perfect on everything from wide monitors to mobile screens.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS3:** Advanced positioning, z-index management, and keyframe animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Event listeners, DOM manipulation, and style toggling for modal states.
* **Development Tools:** VS Code for local development and GitHub Pages for hosting.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details
This project fulfills all requirements for Task 12:

* **Grid Layout:** Implemented a robust grid using `display: grid`.
* **Dynamic Content:** Used JS to swap the `src` and `alt` attributes of the modal image instantly.
* **Focus Management:** Implemented `overflow: hidden` on the body tag to lock scrolling while the modal is active.
* **Animation:** Smooth entry and exit transitions using CSS `opacity` and `transform`.

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
* **Phase 2:** Implement an **Infinite Scroll** feature that loads more images as the user reaches the bottom.
* **Phase 3:** Add **Lightbox Controls** (Next/Previous arrows) to navigate images within the modal.
* **Phase 4:** Integrate the **Unsplash API** to pull high-resolution professional photography dynamically.
